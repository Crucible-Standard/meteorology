# Contributing to  meteorology

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Crucible-Standard projects. 

> All contributors must adhear to the adopted  [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org) [v1.4.0](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/) Code of Conduct outlined in our [Code of Conduct Section](https://github.com/Crucible-Standard/meteorology/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Generally we try to just not be a jerk, and always be welcoming as a policy, but recently we wanted to codify it for all new contributors to have clear guidelines.
